# Dev Test

## Dev Process
1. Download Assets
2. Develop page by section
3. Responsive Design
4. add functionality
5. add animations

## Set up
1.npm run to compile sass and jquery
2. npm run compile:sass to watch my changes

### I break the pages down by sections in order to make it managable. 
Start by writing down variables- colors, fonts, and reusable classes.
Leaving notes on all my classes so someone else can edit my work with ease.
